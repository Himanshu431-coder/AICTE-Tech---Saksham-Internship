# AI Based Fitness Calorie Tracker Using Python (AICTE Internship Project)


# AI-Based Fitness Calorie Tracker

## Project Overview
The **AI-Based Fitness Calorie Tracker** is an innovative application developed as part of my internship submission for the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). This project leverages artificial intelligence to assist users in tracking their calorie intake based on their fitness activity data. By employing advanced machine learning models, the application aims to provide accurate predictions of calories burned during various physical activities.

## Key Features
- **Calorie Prediction**: Utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict calorie expenditure based on user-input fitness activity data.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Developed using Streamlit, this feature allows users to seamlessly input their fitness data and receive real-time predictions regarding calories burned.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing critical data trends, enhancing users' understanding of their calorie consumption and exercise performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit  
- **Data Manipulation Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas  
- **Data Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn  

## Machine Learning Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Implemented to predict continuous values such as calories burned based on user activity.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Employed to enhance prediction accuracy through the aggregation of multiple decision trees.
- **Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV)**: Utilized for optimizing hyperparameters, thereby improving overall model performance.

## Internship Mentor
This project was conducted under the mentorship of **Mr. Somya Chaudhary**, whose expertise in machine learning and data science has significantly enriched my learning experience. His guidance facilitated my understanding of practical applications of machine learning algorithms, model optimization techniques, and effective data visualization strategies.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout this internship, I acquired practical skills in implementing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest. I gained hands-on experience in essential processes including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search CV. Furthermore, I successfully integrated a machine learning model into an interactive web application using Streamlit. Additionally, I honed my analytical skills by utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, and effectively visualizing results with Matplotlib and Seaborn. This internship has been instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.
